# Introduction
This model aims to predict medical insurance charges, taking into account potential factors that may influence the varying costs of medical care. The predictive power derived from the models will prove crucial to medical insurance providers in characterizing optimal resource allocation and developing effective pricing strategies.

# Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and pre-processing
The dataset ‚Äòmedical_insurance.csv‚Äô consists of 1338 observations alongside 7 variables that are descriptively listed in the Appendix 1.1. The dependent variable ‚Äòcharges‚Äô holds a quantitative nature, being recognized as a continuous variable, allowing us to advance using a regression model. To explore the dataset, I will create a correlogram - examining the prevalent trends and relationships amongst the variables, leading the primary exploration of data wrangling.
